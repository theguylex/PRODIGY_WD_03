## A Tictactoe game with option to play with AI

This is my personal portfolio page

* HTML file contains a H1 element for the title of the game and a div housing 9 other elements serving as cells that can be marked in the game with Xs and Os. We also have an empty H2 element with a class of 'status' which toggles innertext display of which player's turn it is.

* CSS gives the background of the body a yellow colour and dark texts except the buttons at the bottom of the page which have white texts and black background and on hover has a dark text and white background with black borders.

* With JavaScript, winning combinations are stored in an array. Cells and buttons have click eventlisteners which carried out varying functions. Some functions that can be found in the file are; handleclick(), placemark(), swapTurns() e.t.c
